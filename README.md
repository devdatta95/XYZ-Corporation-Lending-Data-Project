People often save their money in the banks which offer security but with lower interest rates. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. It is transforming the banking system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding. But this comes with a high risk of borrowers defaulting the loans. Hence there is a need to classify each borrower as defaulter or not using the data collected when the loan has been given.
